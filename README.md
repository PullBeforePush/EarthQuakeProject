# Building an End-To-End Data engineering project using Microsoft Fabric

## **Welcome to my first Data Engineering project!**

In this project, we'll explore building a data pipeline using **Microsoft Fabric**, applying the **Medallion Architecture** to organize earthquake data—from raw to refined—for easier analysis.

We'll source data from the **USGS Earthquake Hazards Program API**, and by the end of the project, we will have created an **automated system** that retrieves earthquake data, processes it, and delivers updated insights daily via **Power BI** dashboards.

## **Business Case**

Earthquake data is invaluable for understanding seismic activity and mitigating associated risks.
Government agencies, research institutions, and insurance companies depend on timely, accurate information to plan emergency responses and assess potential hazards. This automated pipeline ensures that these stakeholders receive up-to-date data in a clear, accessible format—saving time, enhancing decision-making, and supporting more effective risk management.
