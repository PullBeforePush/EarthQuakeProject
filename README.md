# Building an End-To-End Data engineering project using Microsoft Fabric

## **Welcome to my first Data Engineering project!**

In this project, we'll explore building a data pipeline using **Microsoft Fabric**, applying the **Medallion Architecture** to organize earthquake data—from raw to refined—for easier analysis.

We'll source data from the **USGS Earthquake Hazards Program API**, and by the end of the project, we will have created an **automated system** that retrieves earthquake data, processes it, and delivers updated insights daily via **Power BI** dashboards.
